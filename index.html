    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student learning how to teach computational thinking through
      hands-on and reflective activities. I am interested in helping students
      build confidence with programming concepts.

    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I believe students learn best when they can experiment, make mistakes,
      and reflect on their thinking. Computational thinking should be accessible
      and engaging for all learners.

  <h2>Project Videos</h2>

  <p>
    This first video explains a Scratch animation project where I introduce the
    purpose of the program and walk through how the code works step by step.
    I describe how sequencing and basic movement blocks are used to create
    an animated scene, and I reflect on how different blocks contribute to the
    overall behavior of the sprite.

  <p>
    This second video focuses more closely on explaining how code executes in
    Scratch. I highlight how repeated actions, timing, and movement work together,
    and I discuss how small changes to the code can affect the program’s output.
    This video emphasizes building understanding through explanation and reflection.

  <h2>Using Repeat Loops in Scratch</h2>

  <p>
    This code explanation video demonstrates how repeat loops work in Scratch.
    I explain the purpose of my program, how different repeat blocks control
    movement and animation, and how changing the number of repeats affects the
    sprite’s behavior. This helps show my understanding of repetition as a key
    computational thinking concept.

  <h2>Events in Snap: Monkey and Banana Game</h2>

  <p>
    This video explains how I used events and broadcasts in Snap to create an
    interactive monkey and banana game. I describe how different sprites respond
    to events, how broadcasts allow sprites to communicate, and how changing
    event behaviors would affect the program. This demonstrates my understanding
    of event-driven programming and interaction between sprites.
