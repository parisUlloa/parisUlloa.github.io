    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student learning how to teach computational thinking through
      hands-on and reflective activities. I am interested in helping students
      build confidence with programming concepts.

    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I believe students learn best when they can experiment, make mistakes,
      and reflect on their thinking. Computational thinking should be accessible
      and engaging for all learners.

  <h2>Project Videos</h2>

  <p>
    This first video explains a Scratch animation project where I introduce the
    purpose of the program and walk through how the code works step by step.
    I describe how sequencing and basic movement blocks are used to create
    an animated scene, and I reflect on how different blocks contribute to the
    overall behavior of the sprite.
  </p>

  <p>
    This second video focuses more closely on explaining how code executes in
    Scratch. I highlight how repeated actions, timing, and movement work together,
    and I discuss how small changes to the code can affect the program’s output.
    This video emphasizes building understanding through explanation and reflection.

  <h2>Using Repeat Loops in Scratch</h2>

  <p>
    This code explanation video demonstrates how repeat loops work in Scratch.
    I explain the purpose of my program, how different repeat blocks control
    movement and animation, and how changing the number of repeats affects the
    sprite’s behavior. This helps show my understanding of repetition as a key
    computational thinking concept.

  <h2>Events in Snap: Monkey and Banana Game</h2>

  <p>
    This video explains how I used events and broadcasts in Snap to create an
    interactive monkey and banana game. I describe how different sprites respond
    to events, how broadcasts allow sprites to communicate, and how changing
    event behaviors would affect the program. This demonstrates my understanding
    of event-driven programming and interaction between sprites.

  <h2>Nested Repeats in Snap: Mouse Octagon</h2>

  <p>
    This code explanation video demonstrates how nested repeat loops work in Snap.
    I explain how the outer repeat controls the overall pattern and how the inner
    repeat controls the smaller repeated movement steps. I also describe how changing
    the number of repeats changes the size and shape of the path.

  <h2>Variables and Shapes in Snap</h2>

  <p>
    This video explains how I used variables in Snap to draw different shapes.
    I describe how variables control the number of sides and side length, how events start the program,
    and how changing variable values changes the shapes that are drawn. I also explain how variables
    in programming are different from variables in algebra.

  <h2>Conditional Loops in Snap: Catch the Soccer Ball</h2>

  <p>
    This video explains my Snap program where a soccer ball moves to random
    positions and the user tries to catch it with the mouse. I describe how
    the green flag event starts the program, how a repeat-until loop controls
    the movement, and how random x and y variables make the sprite move to
    unpredictable locations. This demonstrates my understanding of events,
    variables, and conditional loops working together.

  <h2>Snap Target Game: If-Else Score Explanation</h2>

  <p>
    This video explains my Snap code where a blue ball moves randomly and the
    player clicks to score points. I describe how different colored areas
    change the score using if and if-else logic, and how a change in those
    conditions would change the behavior of the program.

  <h2>Nested If-Else in Snap: Norman the Penguin Adventure</h2>

  <p>
    This video explains my Snap program that demonstrates how nested if-else
    statements work. In this project, Norman the Penguin decides whether he can
    go swimming in the ocean based on two conditions: whether he knows how to swim
    and whether he is old enough. I walk through how the outer if-else checks the
    user's input and how the inner (nested) if-else checks the age variable. I also
    explain how changing the conditions would affect the program’s outcome.
